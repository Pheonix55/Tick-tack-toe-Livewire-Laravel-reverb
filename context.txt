1. Project Vision

Goal: Build a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game where two authenticated users can play in real-time, with a professional structure, clean architecture, and robust backend logic.

Key principles:

Real-time gameplay (no page refresh)

Secure (only participants can make moves)

Scalable (support multiple games at once)

Maintainable (clean code, reusable components)

Testable (unit tests for logic, feature tests for gameplay)

2. User Stories / Features

Authentication & User Management

Users must sign up or log in

Users can see available players to start a game

Users can join a game via invite or game ID

Game Lifecycle

Create a new game → assign Player X / Player O

Board initialized empty

Track whose turn it is

Players make moves alternately

Game ends when:

Someone wins → highlight winner

Draw → show draw message

Save game history for replay / analytics

Real-Time Updates

When a player makes a move, opponent sees it instantly

Board updates on both players’ screens

Handle reconnects → fetch latest board state

Game Rules Enforcement

Validate turn order

Prevent invalid moves (cell already filled)

Winner/draw detection server-side

Server-side validation prevents cheating

Game History & Analytics (Professional Touch)

Track every move with timestamp

Store completed games

Optional: stats for players (win/loss ratio, streaks)

Notifications & UI Feedback

Show “Your turn” vs “Opponent’s turn”

Highlight winning combination

Optional: toast notifications or alerts

Responsive UI

Works on desktop and mobile

Clean, minimalistic, modern design

Smooth animations for moves

3. Architecture Overview

Frontend:

Laravel Livewire component for the board

Blade templates with Tailwind or Bootstrap

Event listeners for real-time updates

Backend:

Laravel 10

Models: User, Game, Move

Controllers: minimal — Livewire handles most actions

Validation: server-side only for rules

Broadcasting events: Laravel Echo + WebSockets (Pusher / Self-hosted)

Database:

users → player info

games → current state & metadata

moves → move history (optional but professional)

Realtime Layer:

Each game has a private channel

Events: PlayerMoved, GameEnded, GameCreated

Echo listeners update Livewire components instantly
